A compressed version of "OpenLayers":http://openlayers.org/ that includes only the code necessary
for applications at "projects.latimes.com":http://projects.latimes.com. The objective is to reduce overhead
and speed up the site by cutting out stuff we don't use.

The whole idea is lifted from "the smart people at Development Seed":http://github.com/developmentseed/openlayers_slim.

Built from OpenLayers version 2.9.1
Last Compile: 2010-05-31
